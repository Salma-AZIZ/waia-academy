### Introduction to Machine Learning

This folder contains notebooks on how to build supervised and unsupervised learning models based on some users data. 

For the Data Engineering Bootcamp it is not expected that students master the Data Science workflow and Machine Learning, but this code is just provided for reference. 

For the bootcamp feel free to use this data, do some data exploration and build a simple linear regression model based on the target defined in the notebooks or segment the users based on the k-means clustering algorithm.
